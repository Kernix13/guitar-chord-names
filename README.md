A vanilla JavaScript app to return the name of a guitar chord given the chord fret numbers. The app also returns additional information based on the type of chord returned.

## Live Version

View the [Guitar Chord Namer app](https://everyguitarchord.com/what-chord-is-this.html) on my guitar chords website. You can view more details on the project on [my portfolio](https://courageous-cuchufli-816711.netlify.app/).

## Feedback and Bugs

Open a GitHub issue if you have feedback on the app or find any bugs.

<!-- ## Features in development

I plan to eventually add the following features:

1. Figure out how to show the last selected tuning
1. Find scales that have most of the notes in the chord for more choices for soloing.
1. SVG chord shape for the chord the user enters.
1. The names of chords for non-chord tone slash chords. For example, `C\D♭` equals `D♭m-maj7♭5`. Right now, entering frets #'s for C-E-G-D♭ would return `D♭m-maj7♭5`.
1. Chord substitutes for the user chord. For example, a C major triad would show chords like `A7♯9`, `Am9`, `Am11`, etc.
1. Tritone substitutes: the ability to enter a tritone interval like `B-F` and get a list of any chord in any key that has those notes.

<!-- ## Comparison sites

To see how my guitar chord namer compares to other sites, then do the following on the links below:

- Enter the notes/frets for an A7♭9 or E7♭5, or some other chord which have both a **♯** and **♭** in the chord. Compare their results to mine.
