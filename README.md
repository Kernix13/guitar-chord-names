# Guitar Chord Names

The [Guitar Chord Namer app](https://everyguitarchord.com/what-chord-is-this.html) is on my guitar chords website.

1. Enter the notes of a guitar chord to get the name for the chord, as well as the names of other chords which contain the same notes, the intervals for the chord, and more.
1. Altered tuning select list for your chords if you are playing/writing in altered tunings.
1. Or enter the notes of a chord to find scales that have the all or most of the sane notes (in beta).
1. SVG chord shape for the chord you entered (in beta).
