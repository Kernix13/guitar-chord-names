# Guitar Chord Names

This project is one of my [portfolio](https://kernixwebdesign.com/resume-portfolio.html) items. The actual [Guitar Chord Namer app](https://everyguitarchord.com/what-chord-is-this.html) is on my guitar chords website.

1. Enter the notes of a guitar chord to get the name for the chord, as well as the names of other chords which contain the same notes, the intervals for the chord, and more.
1. Altered tuning select list for your chords if you are playing/writing in altered tunings.

## Features in development

I plan to eventually add the following features:

1. The ability to enter the notes of a chord or scale to find scales that have all, or most of the notes in the scale.
1. SVG chord shape for the chord the user enters.

Check out my website [Every Guitar Chord](https://everyguitarchord.com/ "Every Guitar Chord website") for quality blog posts and PDF files for download.

## Comparison sites

To see how my guitar chord namer compares to other sites, then do the following on the links below:

- enter the notes/frets for an A7♭9 or E7♭5, or some other chord which have both a **♯** and **♭** in the chord.

Here are links to the sites on page 1 of the SERPs using "Guitar Chord Namer" as the search term:
